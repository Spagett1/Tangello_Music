# Install instructions:
Dependancies:
`rust/cargo` (for development or compiling)
```
mpd
```
1: Set up mpd and start it, the following is a good basic config file if you are running linux 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice/master/.config/mpd/mpd.conf
Put that file into `~/.config/mpd/mpd.conf` then start up mpd.

If you are running windows please follow part 1 of this guide https://dsync.blogspot.com/2012/05/setting-up-mpd-ncmpcpp-others-on.html.

2: Git clone the repo and cd into it.
```
git clone https://github.com/Laar3/Tangello_Music/
cd Tangello_Music
```
## 3: Install.

### Option 1.
Go to the github releases https://github.com/Laar3/Tangello_Music/releases and download the latest binary for your platform.

### Option 2, compiling from source.
For developement simply run `cargo run` inside the project directory

For building the final product with all optimisations enabled, run.

```cargo build --release```

Depending on your platform it will generate a program in the directory `target/release/` called `tangello_music` (Linux and MacOs) or `tangello_music.exe` on windows. 

4: Run the binary with `./tangello_music` or copy it into your path.

# Random facts:

Because of a limitation in mpd-rs that i havnt been able to figure out yet album art requires you to specify the music folder in the settings of tangello, not just in your mpd config file like normal. This is not a super high priority to be fixed as im not sure how to go about it but its on my radar.
